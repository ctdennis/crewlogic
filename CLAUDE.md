# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Dev tooling & approval discipline (READ FIRST)

Approvals in `.claude/settings.local.json` match by **exact command prefix, one command at a time**. A pipe (`|`), redirect (`>` / `2>&1`), `;`/`&&` chain, or an **absolute path** makes a command miss its allow-rule and forces an unnecessary prompt. Therefore:

- **Run dev tooling in EXACTLY these forms** — relative path, from the repo root, **no `|`, no `>`/`2>&1`, no `;`/`&&`, no absolute paths.** Read the JSON/text output directly; if you must filter it, do that in a separate step.
  - Dev SQL (wrapper refuses unless linked to crewlogic-dev): `bash supabase/dev-setup/dev-sql.sh "<sql>"`
  - **Read-only PROD SQL** (allowlisted; refuses unless linked to prod; rejects anything but a single read statement AND runs it inside a `READ ONLY` transaction so Postgres blocks any write): `bash supabase/dev-setup/prod-readonly-sql.sh "<SELECT ...>"`. Use this for prod SELECTs instead of `supabase db query` (which stays gated, since it can also write).
  - Syntax-check index.html: `bash supabase/dev-setup/check-html.sh`
  - Deploy a function to dev: `supabase functions deploy --project-ref bagkimfwmpwjfhfhmsrb <name> --use-api --no-verify-jwt`
  - Set a dev secret: `supabase secrets set --project-ref bagkimfwmpwjfhfhmsrb KEY=VALUE`
- **Read-only inspection — don't self-inflict prompts.** The matcher reads the WHOLE command string; it decomposes simple `&&`/`;`/`|` chains, but does NOT see through **command substitution `$(...)`**, **`for`-loops**, **heredocs** (`<<'PY'`), or a **leading `VAR=...;`** assignment — those read as one opaque command and prompt even when the work is read-only. So:
  - **Prefer the Read tool for files** (never prompts on allowed paths) and a single plain Bash command otherwise. No `cd`-prefix (the working dir persists), no chains, no `$(...)`, no loops, no heredocs.
  - Find a line → `grep -n "<pat>" index.html`, then read the range with the **Read tool** (not `sed -n "$(...)"`).
  - Inspect a deployed prod edge fn → `supabase functions download <name> --project-ref ozfkpxyachigfpcmvekz --workdir /tmp/fn-reconcile --use-api`, then `diff` (read-only).
  - Heredoc one-liners (`python3 - <<'PY'` for the control-byte scan / inline-script V8 parse) are inherently un-allowlistable — use them ONLY when a check genuinely needs them, and expect the prompt.
- **Before ANY command that may prompt** (anything prod-touching, destructive, or not matching an allow-rule), FIRST write a one-line plain-English note — **What it does · what it touches (dev vs prod) · impact & reversibility** — then run it. Never fire a gated command without that line.
- **Read-only prod access is PRE-APPROVED** (owner standing approval, 2026-05-27): inspecting prod is fine without asking — e.g. `supabase functions logs ... --project-ref ozfkpxyachigfpcmvekz`, `supabase secrets list` (names/digests only), read-only `SELECT`s and `GET`s against prod (incl. via the public anon key). **Still write the one-line note first.** "Read-only" means **nothing is mutated** — no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, no deploy, no secret set/unset, no config change. Anything that writes to prod stays gated.
- **Always gated (do not bypass):** `git push origin main`; `supabase functions deploy` / `secrets set` / `secrets unset` with the **prod** ref `ozfkpxyachigfpcmvekz`; `supabase db push`; any prod **write**.

## What this is

CrewLogicAI is a single-page web app for The Junkluggers franchise crews/owners: AI-assisted junk-removal estimating, pricing, job planning, route/truck-load math, and a "yard signs" tracking/rewards game. **The entire application lives in one file: `index.html` (~18.4k lines).** There is no build step, no package manager, no test suite, and no framework — it is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with CDN-loaded libraries.

## Project status — read `.HUB/Hub.md` first

**`.HUB/Hub.md` is the single source of truth for project / build / production-rollout status** (migrated from `docs/STATUS.md` on 2026-06-11; the old path is now a redirect stub). For any "where are we / what's done / what's shipped" question, **read that file instead of re-deriving status from the code** — re-analyzing `index.html` + the edge functions is expensive and was only necessary because the docs had drifted. Feature specs live in `docs/Feature-StandaloneMode/` and the Hub links to them.

Keep it current with the **check → update → recheck** protocol (also stated at the top of the Hub):
1. **Check** the relevant row *before* starting a change.
2. **Update** the row (Build / Prod / Version / Open items) *in the same commit* as the change — never let the tracker lag the code.
3. **Recheck** after the change landed and stamp **Last verified** with the date. If a field (e.g. prod-tenant usage) couldn't be verified, say so in Notes rather than guessing. Trust entries with a recent *Last verified*; re-verify stale ones.

## Architecture

`index.html` is structured as three sequential blocks:
- **Lines ~1–53** — pre-init `<script>`: `initAuth()` wiring and the Google OAuth redirect (`triggerGoogleSignIn`).
- **Lines ~54–1024** — `<style>`: all CSS, driven by CSS custom properties (`--bg-input`, `--text-muted`, `--radius-sm`, etc.) defined on `:root`.
- **Lines ~1026–3313** — `<body>`: every screen as a sibling element (`#loginScreen`, `#homeScreen`, `#estimatorScreen`, `#estimateEditorScreen`, `#estimatesScreen`, `#settingsScreen`, `#priceLookupScreen`, `#jobPlanScreen`, `#signsScreen`, etc.), plus modals.
- **Lines ~3314–18343** — the main `<script>`: all application logic.

### Navigation
There is no router. Screens are sibling DOM nodes; `hideAll()` (~line 4847) iterates the `allScreens` array and hides every screen (toggling `.active` for `*-section` elements, `style.display='none'` for others), then a `show*`/`render*` function reveals the target. When adding a screen, register its ID in the `allScreens` array or it won't hide correctly on navigation.

### Naming conventions
- `show*` functions reveal/populate a screen or modal (`showApp`, `showLogin`, `showSettingsTab`, `showPDFOptions`).
- `render*` functions rebuild the innerHTML of a list/section (`renderEstimatesList`, `renderJobPlan`, `renderCharges`, `renderSignsView`).
- `calc*`/`calculate*` are the pricing/volume/route math engines (`calculateEstimate`, `calcVolumePrice`, `calculateMattress`, `calcPallets`, `calculateDistances`).

## Backend (Supabase)

The app is fully client-side; all state lives in Supabase. Constants are defined near line 3607:
- `SUPABASE_URL = https://ozfkpxyachigfpcmvekz.supabase.co`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — publishable anon key, hardcoded (this is expected for the anon flow).

**Data access goes through two helpers — use them, don't call `fetch` to Supabase directly:**
- `supabaseFetch(path, opts)` (~line 3666) — wraps PostgREST `/rest/v1/...` calls; injects `apikey` + auth headers and `Prefer: return=representation`; tolerates empty bodies (204/DELETE).
- `edgeFunctionCall(name, body)` (~line 3323) — invokes Edge Functions at `/functions/v1/...`.
- `supabaseClient` (the supabase-js UMD client) is used **only** for Storage signed URLs. Photos go to the `estimate-photos` bucket via `uploadPhotoToSupabase()`; display URLs come from `resolvePhotoUrl()`, which caches signed URLs for 12h and handles legacy Google Drive URLs.

### Tables (PostgREST)
`profiles`, `franchises`, `estimates`, `customer_price_lists`, `invites`, `crew_members`, `tools`, `job_plans`, `campaigns`, `feedback`, and the yard-signs set (`yard_signs`, `sign_credits`, `sign_status_events`, `sign_rewards`, `sign_sessions`).

Tenancy & Vonigo tables:
- `tenants` — parent of `franchises`; **`tenants.id` is the multi-tenant boundary.** Junkluggers tenant UUID: `946a4535-aa61-45b6-a6fb-9190ff546d41`.
- `vonigo_credentials` — links franchises to encrypted Vonigo credentials via Supabase Vault.
- `vonigo_credential_audit` — audit log for Vonigo credential access/changes.

### Edge Functions
Source lives in `supabase/functions/<name>/index.ts` (see "Supabase CLI" below). Deploy a single function with `supabase functions deploy <name>`.
- `crewlogic-ai` — AI estimate analysis (`action: 'analyzeEstimate'` with transcript/areas/photos); also handles estimate-submission AI actions.
- `crewlogic-settings` — franchise/cost/proposal settings reads & writes.
- `crewlogic-oauth-callback` — Google OAuth code exchange + profile provisioning; redirects back with `?session=...` or `?auth_error=...`.
- `crewlogic-job-plan` — job plan generation/persistence.
- `crewlogic-todays-workorders` — fetches today's work orders (Vonigo).
- `crewlogic-price-lookup` — pricing lookups.
- `crewlogic-estimate` — estimate save (`save` upserts to the `estimates` table) and `calcDistances` (Google Maps Distance Matrix lookup for cost-analysis routing). Replaces the n8n `save` + `calcDistances` webhook equivalents. Also handles `searchClients`, `delete`, and `submitQuote` (all migrated from n8n; they auth to Vonigo directly via MD5 `/security/login/` — **no OAuth**, the old "requires Vonigo OAuth" note was wrong).
- `crewlogic-pricing` — native price-book lookup for `crm_provider='none'` franchises (reads `price_lists` / `price_list_zips`). Returns the **same JSON shape** as `crewlogic-price-lookup` so the frontend estimating engine is unchanged — only the data source swaps. The client picks between them via `currentUser.pricingSource === 'native'` (~line 3615).
- `crewlogic-job-lookup` — looks up a single Vonigo job by `jobID` and returns the client/contact/location IDs + display info needed to hydrate an estimate. MD5 `/security/login/` auth (no Vonigo OAuth). Replaces the n8n `crewlogic-job-lookup` webhook.
- `crewlogic-trucks` — returns current truck GPS locations from Motive (gomotive.com); used by the Route Optimizer truck-distance display. Requires the `MOTIVE_API_KEY` secret. (The large route-optimization engine still lives in n8n.)
- `crewlogic-signup` — native self-provisioning: creates the tenant + franchise + profile for the native (non-Vonigo) signup flow. Junkluggers `@junkluggers.com` emails do **not** self-provision natively.
- `crewlogic-accept-invite` — provisions a profile from a pending invite token (service role); used by the invite-link flow (~line 3881).
- `crewlogic-photo-sweep` — **daily pg_cron job** (via pg_net). Permanently deletes soft-deleted estimate photos whose `deletedAt` is >30 days old, prunes the matching `estimates.payload.charges[*].deletedPhotos` JSONB entries (via SQL helpers `sweep_find_expired_photos()` / `sweep_prune_expired_photos()`), and removes the files from the `estimate-photos` Storage bucket. Idempotent; safe to call manually.
- `crewlogic-signs-lifecycle` — **daily pg_cron job** (via pg_net). Ages yard signs `active → gray` (after `graySignDays`, default 15) and `gray → hidden` (after `hiddenSignDays`, default 60) per-franchise via the SQL function `signs_daily_lifecycle()`; logs transitions to `sign_status_events` and posts a Slack summary if `SLACK_SIGNS_WEBHOOK` is set. Idempotent.

### Auth & multi-tenancy
Google OAuth uses `hd=junkluggers.com` for direct sign-ins. Today all owner accounts in production happen to have `@junkluggers.com` Google addresses. The invite-link flow exists and bypasses the `hd=` restriction (intended for inviting estimators with non-junkluggers email accounts), but currently no non-junkluggers.com accounts have actually used it. Adding email/password and magic-link auth for non-Google estimators is on the roadmap.

After callback, `currentUser` holds `role` (`'owner'` | `'estimator'`), `franchiseID` (external), `franchiseInternalID`, `tenantID`, `franchiseName`. **Most queries are scoped by `currentUser.franchiseID` / tenant — preserve this scoping when writing new queries.** Access is gated in `showApp` by subscription `status` (`active`/`trialing`/`tester`/`pro`/`enterprise`); otherwise `#paywallScreen` shows.

### Guest / tester access — never lock testers out
**Guest and tester accounts MUST keep working app access throughout the development process. A tester losing access mid-development is a regression — treat it like a P1 bug.**

How access is decided (**Epic A, 2026-07-11 — access = `subscription_status` ONLY**): `buildSessionFromSupabaseAuth` (index.html ~5634) resolves the gate value as **franchise `subscription_status` if set (authoritative — it GRANTs or REVOKEs), else tenant `subscription_status` if it's an access value, else `'trialing'`**. `subscription_tier` is the **plan label only — it never grants or revokes access** (so a canceled `pro` with `status=canceled` is correctly paywalled). `showApp` grants entry if the value is in `active | trialing | tester` (otherwise `#paywallScreen`). Testers grant via **tenant (or franchise) `subscription_status='tester'`**. Historical note: an older gate let franchise `subscription_tier` override tenant status, paywalling testers whose franchise was `free` (#54 Thomas Baldwin, #31, 2026-06-05); Epic A removed tier from the access path entirely, so that class of bug can't recur.

Rules:
- **When provisioning/creating a tester or guest franchise, set `subscription_status='tester'`** (tenant, or franchise for a franchise-authoritative grant). **Do NOT rely on `subscription_tier`** — tier is not an access value. New native franchises default `subscription_tier='free'` (the canonical no-plan label; harmless, never read for access).
- **Before AND after** any change to auth, the access gate, RLS, provisioning, or `buildSessionFromSupabaseAuth`/`showApp`: confirm a tester can still sign in and reach the app (not the paywall). Enumerate the current testers with `select f.external_id from franchises f join tenants t on t.id=f.tenant_id where t.subscription_status='tester'` (read-only) and check none are about to be blocked.
- **Access = status, plan = tier — keep them separate.** Never reintroduce a tier value into the access decision.

### Legacy n8n
**Only ONE live n8n dependency remains: the route-optimization engine** — `apiFetch(N8N_BASE + '/crewlogic-route')` (index.html ~7341). `N8N_BASE` (line ~3524) and the `apiFetch` helper exist solely to serve it. Everything else has been migrated to Supabase Edge Functions. Prefer Edge Functions for new work; do not add new n8n calls. (Some stale code comments still mention an "n8n cron sweep" for photos — that's actually the `crewlogic-photo-sweep` pg_cron job now.)

### Supabase CLI
The repo is linked to the Supabase project `ozfkpxyachigfpcmvekz` via the Supabase CLI. The `supabase/` folder holds:
- `config.toml` — project config generated by `supabase init` (project_id `crewlogic`).
- `.gitignore` — excludes CLI-local state (`.temp/`, `.branches`, env files); these are **not** committed.
- `functions/<name>/index.ts` — one folder per Edge Function. Function source is being brought under management here (see "Edge Function source code" below).

Common commands (run from repo root):
- `supabase functions deploy <name>` — deploy one function to the linked project.
- `supabase functions deploy` — deploy all functions.
- `supabase functions serve <name>` — run a function locally.

## CDN dependencies (loaded in `<head>`)
`jspdf` (PDF generation), `pdf-lib` (PDF manipulation), `heic2any` (iPhone HEIC → JPEG), `piexifjs` (EXIF), `@supabase/supabase-js`. Plus Google Maps Street View (`STREET_VIEW_KEY`).

## Development workflow

- **Run locally:** open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder (`python3 -m http.server`). No build.
- **Versioning:** **single source of truth** — bump the `<meta name="crewlogic-version">` tag (line 5) on each release. Everything else derives from it at runtime: the console startup banner and `_FEEDBACK_APP_VERSION` both read the meta tag (`document.querySelector('meta[name="crewlogic-version"]').content`). Do **not** reintroduce hardcoded version strings elsewhere. Current: `5.9.81`. (Historical note: the console banner had silently drifted to 5.9.75 because it was a separate hardcoded string; the derive-from-meta refactor in 5.9.81 fixed that.)
- **Deploy (dev-first, via Claude Code):** Edit `index.html` on the **`dev`** branch, bump the version meta, `bash supabase/dev-setup/check-html.sh`, commit, `git push origin dev`. Cloudflare Pages auto-builds the dev preview at **`dev.crewlogic.pages.dev`** (~1-2 min), which runs in dev mode against the **dev** Supabase — test there (sign in via the injected "🔧 Dev sign-in · Vonigo #90" button; seed the dev DB for data-dependent UI). **Promote** with `git checkout main`, then `git merge --no-ff dev -m "Merge dev → main: <what shipped> (vX.Y.Z)"`, then `git push origin main` (the `main` push is gated). **Use `--no-ff`, not `--ff-only`** — `main`'s history is a chain of `Merge dev → main:` commits, so the branches always diverge structurally and `--ff-only` will abort. **Before pushing, verify the merge brought only what you intended:** `git diff <pre-merge-main-sha> HEAD -- index.html` should show only your change's hunks (this is the guard against the past PDF-cover-clobber class of merge regression). Cloudflare auto-deploys `main` to `crewlogicai.com` (custom domain). The `crewlogic.pages.dev` URL still resolves as a transition fallback. (Legacy flow — downloading `index.html` from a Claude.ai chat → GitHub Desktop → `main` — is retired.)

## Dev-promotion test discipline (every version bump)

**Every `index.html` version bump gets a right-sized test script, handed to the owner immediately after the push to `dev`.** The workflow is: discuss the change → promote to `dev` → provide the exact steps to verify it on `dev.crewlogic.pages.dev`. **Robustness scales with the risk of getting it wrong, not with effort.** Owner decided this 2026-07-12 and explicitly rejected an automated browser-E2E platform (Playwright/Selenium-style) — the setup + ongoing maintenance tax against a rapidly-changing single-file UI outweighs the value at this team size and pace. Testing stays **manual, owner-executed**, with me generating the right-sized steps.

Risk tiers (when in doubt, tier up):
- **LOW** — cosmetic, copy, a single field, icon look (e.g. the truck-marker shape): **1–3 quick steps.** "Load dev, go to X, confirm Y looks right."
- **MEDIUM** — a data write, a new screen, a multi-step flow, anything with 2+ touch points: **walk the full flow** end to end with an explicit **Expected** at each step, plus the **read-back** that proves it persisted.
- **HIGH** — payment processing, auth/login, the access gate, provisioning/dedup, anything **hard to back out** or spanning many touch points: **full critical-path coverage** — the money/critical paths **and** the failure/edge cases (declined card, downgrade, cap boundary, wrong-tenant), each with a read-back (DB row, Stripe object, webhook credit).

Write the steps per the "Writing test plans / QA scripts" section below (executable cold: exact clicks, values, Expected). For any change that touches an **edge function or its contract**, also run the edge-function **API smoke checks** — a small set of `curl` checks against the deployed dev function URLs asserting the endpoint is alive and returns the expected status/shape. These test *contracts* (which drift far less than the UI), so they don't rot like browser E2E; deliberately a handful of stable checks, not an automation platform.

## Writing test plans / QA scripts

Write every test plan so **someone with zero context can execute it cold** — never assume the reader knows the app, the accounts, or "what you meant." Be explicit at every step: exact environment/URL → exact screen to navigate to → exact field → exact value to type → exact button/control to tap → an explicit **Expected** result, with a Pass/Fail + Notes slot per test. Do **not** collapse steps ("log in and make an estimate") — spell out each click.

A good plan includes, up front:
- An **accounts table**: which login to use, how each one signs in (Google vs. email magic-link), and its role/workspace.
- A **conventions block** that states the fiddly, repeated actions ONCE: how to open a *fresh* incognito window, how to read the version banner in the Console (F12), and the magic-link rule — *copy the link from the email and paste it into the address bar of the same window; do not click it* (clicking opens the default browser, not the incognito window).
- **Per-test preconditions** (which account is signed in, required data state) and a clear **why** line.

Order tests by risk (the change most likely to break first). Save reusable plans under `docs/` as `docs/qa-test-plan-<version>.md`. Reference example: `docs/qa-test-plan-v5.25.0.md`.

## Edge Function source code

Each Edge Function has a folder under `supabase/functions/<name>/` with its real `index.ts` committed to the repo (shared helpers live in `supabase/functions/_shared/`). As of 2026-06-02 all 14 deployed functions' source is under management here and verified byte-for-byte against prod, so they are editable directly via Claude Code.

Workflow: edit `supabase/functions/<name>/index.ts`, then deploy with `supabase functions deploy <name>` (prod deploys with the `ozfkpxyachigfpcmvekz` ref stay gated — see the approval discipline section). To re-verify a function against prod without deploying, download it read-only (`supabase functions download <name> --project-ref ozfkpxyachigfpcmvekz --workdir /tmp/fn-<name> --use-api`) and `diff` against the repo copy.

## Environments

Two Supabase projects: **prod** (`ozfkpxyachigfpcmvekz`) and **dev/`crewlogic-dev`** (`bagkimfwmpwjfhfhmsrb`). The dev project is used to build & verify features before promotion (see the dev tooling in the approval-discipline section: `dev-sql.sh`, `prod-readonly-sql.sh`). **The frontend now has a matching dev/prod split** (working since v5.27.1, 2026-06-07): it's still ONE `index.html`, which auto-detects its environment by hostname (`IS_DEV_ENV`, ~line 3525) and targets the **dev** Supabase on `dev.crewlogic.pages.dev` / `localhost` and **prod** elsewhere (`SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ternaries ~3526). The **`dev` git branch** deploys to `dev.crewlogic.pages.dev`; promote to prod by merging `dev` → `main` (see the Deploy bullet above). Do **not** fork `index.html` into two files — use the branches.

## SQL migrations

Migrations live in `supabase/migrations/` (sequential `NNNN_description.sql`; e.g. `0002_standalone_pricing_customers.sql`, `0004_tenant_provider_capabilities.sql`). Apply to dev first via the dev tooling, then promote to prod. Some older/ad-hoc SQL was historically run directly in the dashboard SQL Editor; new schema changes should be added as a numbered migration here.

## Time zones & dates (multi-tenant) — READ before any date/calendar/epoch code

CrewLogic is **multi-tenant across time zones** (franchises in ET, CT, MT, PT, Arizona/no-DST, Hawaii, Alaska). Any calendar, schedule, "today's jobs", availability, holiday, or epoch logic MUST resolve the **franchise's own time zone** and convert in it. **Never hardcode Eastern, never assume the server/user zone, and never `Date.UTC(y,m,d,…)` to represent a *local* wall-clock moment** (that treats the clock face as UTC and lands 4–5h early — the recurring bug, owner-flagged 2026-06-20).

- **Canonical pattern — reuse it:** `crewlogic-route-disposal/index.ts` has `STATE_TZ` (every US state → IANA zone incl. `HI: Pacific/Honolulu`, `AZ: America/Phoenix`), `resolveTimezone(cs)` = `cs.officeTimezone || STATE_TZ[cs.officeState] || 'America/New_York'`, and `localParts(date, tz)` via `Intl.DateTimeFormat({ timeZone: tz })` (DST-safe). New date code should call the same helpers (lift them to `_shared/` when a second function needs them).
- **Wall-clock → epoch must be TZ-aware** (offset is NOT constant — DST). Verify EVERY epoch with the system clock before trusting it: `date -r <epoch>` (local) and `date -u -r <epoch>` (UTC); encode with `TZ="America/New_York" date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" "2026-06-20 08:30:00" +%s`. Anchor: 8:30 AM EDT Sat 6/20/26 = `1781958600`; Eastern midnight that day = `1781928000` (NOT `Date.UTC(...)`=`1781913600`, which is Fri 8 PM ET).
- **Vonigo exception — do NOT "fix":** `crewlogic-todays-workorders` `getEasternMidnightEpoch` uses `Date.UTC` ON PURPOSE because Vonigo's WorkOrder **date fields** use a naive-Eastern (clock-as-UTC) convention. That's correct for filtering Vonigo date fields — but it is hardcoded Eastern, so it (and `crewlogic-job-plan` ~line 276 `nowET`) will be wrong for non-ET franchises. **Open follow-up: generalize both to `resolveTimezone()` before any non-Eastern franchise onboards** (see `.HUB/Hub.md`). #90 is ET so it's not breaking today.
- **Vonigo `/resources/availability`** returns `startTime` = **minutes-from-franchise-local-midnight** (720 = 12:00 PM, maps exactly to the schedule board). Send true (TZ-aware) epochs for `dateStart`/`dateEnd`; keep `dateEnd` within the target day to avoid next-day spillover.

## Branding

The rebrand from "CrewLogic" to "CrewLogicAI" happened recently. The brand name **CrewLogicAI** applies to: the app header, browser title, the login/invite/paywall screens, and the domain. Some user-facing strings still say "CrewLogic" **intentionally** — PDF filenames, invite copy, and the sign-out confirmation (per the rebrand decision noted in past chat sessions). Don't "fix" those to CrewLogicAI without checking.

## Editing notes

- Because everything is in one file, use line-anchored or uniquely-scoped edits; the same UI patterns (inline `onclick`, `style.display` toggles) repeat hundreds of times.
- UI is inline-style heavy and uses the CSS variables above — match existing variables rather than hardcoding colors.
- **Button color standard (locked 2026-06-15):** secondary/utility buttons on dark surfaces use `.btn-surface` or `var(--btn-surface)` (#34485d) / `var(--btn-surface-border)` (#46596d) — NOT `--bg-input` (#253545), which is nearly identical to `--bg-card` (#1e2f40) and renders buttons near-invisible. Primary/accent buttons keep `--accent-green`/`--accent-yellow`.
- The app is mobile-first / PWA-style (`apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, fixed viewport, no user scaling).
